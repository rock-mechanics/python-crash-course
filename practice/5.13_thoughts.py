1 . python can be used to generate webpage. and serving to other people.
2 . we can build a web application for documents for collabration called docstring, 
    it allows user to make contribution to the document, and push changes to the owner of the document.
    much like github concept but in an elegant and less geeky way.
3 . we can also build a website for education purposes. so users can upload their videos and get payment.
    a community will be built by sharing their knowleges and a review team will be established to make sure 
    the content is good enough.
